When talking about {{crowdsec.name}} or {{cli.name}} configurations, most of things are going to gravitate around {{parsers.htmlname}},  {{scenarios.htmlname}} and {{collections.htmlname}}.

In most common setup, all these configurations should be found on the {{hub.htmlname}} and installed with {{cli.name}}.

It is important to keep those configurations up-to-date via the `{{cli.name}} upgrade` command.

See the [{{cli.name}} list](/cheat_sheets/cscli-collections-tour/) command to view the state of your deployed configurations.
