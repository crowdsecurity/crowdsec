#-------------------------
# plugin-specific options

# The following template receives a list of models.Alert objects
# The output goes in the http request body
format: |
  {{.|toJson}}

# To dynamically add query parameters to the URL and customize the body,
# use a JSON format with "url_query_params" and "request_body" fields.
# "url_query_params" is a key-value map appended as query parameters to the url.
# "request_body" becomes the HTTP request body.
# If the format output is not JSON or lacks these fields, the full output
# is sent as the body to the static url (default behavior).
#
# Example:
# format: |
#   {"url_query_params": {"ip": "{{ (index . 0).Source.IP }}"}, "request_body": {{.|toJson}}}
#
# With url: https://api.example.com/alerts, this produces:
#   POST https://api.example.com/alerts?ip=1.2.3.4

# The plugin will make requests to this url, eg:  https://www.example.com/
url: <HTTP_url>

# Any of the http verbs: "POST", "GET", "PUT"...
method: POST

# headers:
#   Authorization: token 0x64312313

# skip_tls_verification:  # true or false. Default is false
