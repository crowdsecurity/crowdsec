Running the tests in this directory WILL change the system configuration in
unpredictable ways, remove packages and data (with a peculiar appetite for
databases) and possibly bring the system to an unusable state.

They are meant to be run, as root, on temporary VMs. They are only intended to
ease the development of configurations for "cscli setup detect".
